    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Cocoa Powder</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Vanilla</li>
        <li>Leaveners</li>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir together the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl. Add the wet ingredients and beat with an electric mixer for about three minutes. Stir in the boiling water by hand.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into two prepared cake pans. Bake in a preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool slightly before removing from the pans.</li>
            <li>While the cake finishes cooling to room temperature, make the frosting: Cream the butter, stir in the cocoa and confectioners' sugar alternately with the milk and vanilla, and beat until it's smooth and spreadable.

                When the cake is completely cooled, top each layer with the frosting. Stack them and continue frosting until the cake is completely covered.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
